              Studio Gravitas was established in 2016, with their inaugural project The House of Memories in India. Gravitas represents a collective spirit, a process, and an investigation into architecture and design—driven by the past, present, and future. Gravitas aims to find new meaning and interpretation in their work through a philosophy rooted in phenomenology and timeless architecture.

              For Gravitas, it is a process rather than a product. It is the idea of making rather than building. It is about the atmosphere than mere aesthetics. As a practice, Gravitas firmly believes in the collaborative spirit and a holistic approach to design and a creative process driven by 'we' rather than 'I'.

              Beyond the program, client needs and contextual forces, every project is a journey—an investigation into design rooted in the spirit of a place, history and memory. At times, it is a typological exploration that seeks to redefine the idea of home and living and an opportunity to make a difference.

              Currently, Gravitas is involved in collaborative projects within India and abroad, partnering with design firms and clients who align with this ideology and philosophy.
